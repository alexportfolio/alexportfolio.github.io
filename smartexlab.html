				<h2>SmartexLab</h2>
				<p>SmartexLab is an outsource company located in Belarus.</p>
				<p>Their priorities were to introduce their specialists, completed projects and the speciality that SmartexLab has.</p>
				<p>I took a lot of pictures of their office and people working there. I also did screenshots of projects they had done. In the design there are no stock images, only the real ones that show working processes. Moreover I took part in programming interface with html/css/scss.</p>
