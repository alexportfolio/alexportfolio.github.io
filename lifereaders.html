				<h2>Lifereaders</h2>
				<p>Lifereaders is a platform where it is possible to have a consultation about your life choices.</p>
				<p>They wanted to update their service in order to look fresh and modern, but with interface preservation in order not to lose their old customers.</p>
				<p>I increased the significant stuff in a new design, we had images 4 times bigger than previously. I made design lighter visually and fixed the usecases that were too complicated. I also contributed to programming interface with html/css/scss.</p>
